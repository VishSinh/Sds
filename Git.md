# Git Problem Statement

The problem statement for Git is divided into 3 tasks:

**1**. You have to make a bash script which sets your gpg keys for git so that all your future commits can be gpg-signed.

**2**. Go to [https://gitexercises.fracz.com](https://gitexercises.fracz.com/) and complete the exercises till level "fix-old-typo", including that level. 

**3**. Solve the [Bandit wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) till level 20.
